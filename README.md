# build-pkg

This GitHub action builds a GAP package.

## Usage

The action `build-pkg` has to be called by the workflow of a GAP
package.
It compiles the package.

### Inputs

All of the following inputs are optional.

- `coverage`:
  - Boolean that determines whether code coverage is turned by adding `--coverage` to `CFLAGS`, `CXXFLAGS` and `LDFLAGS`.
  - default: `'true'`

### What's new in v2

- The environment variable `NO_COVERAGE` was replaced by action input `coverage`.
  To disable compiling code with coverage collection enabled, previously one had to
  set `NO_COVERAGE` to any non-empty value. This can now be achieved by setting the
  `coverage` input to `false`.


### Examples
